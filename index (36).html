 <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
 <p> Hi my name is ELLA LOU S. CALDERON and this is my one of the most Unforgettable Experience As a Student</p>

 <p>What I'll Never Forget About is my first day at Bestlink College of the Philppines is that i left my Uniform belt at my Home.
     The Uniform for SHS Student at Bestlink is a dress similar what nuns wear. So i ended up looking a nun hahaha in my oversized dress uniform because it didn't fit me well without the belt. The uniform size given to me is XL, but my size at that time is medium hahaha.</p>

     <p>ps. they didn't give me a belt, even though they said they will give me one, I already finish my first sem but still haven't received any belt. haha.</p>
     <h4>LESSON LEARN</h4>
     <p>before the nightfall, start orginizing your school uniform so they won't look messy when you wear your uniform haha.</p>

     <p>But even so, despite that, my Experience as a student of bestlink is the best. Even thougt I didn't finish my SHS there, many good things happend. I meet new friends who are still my friend no, and they became a godparenst of my son. I also Experience stargazing, and the best part is their Foundation day where many artist attend.</p>
